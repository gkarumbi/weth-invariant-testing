## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Base Invariants
âœ… **Invariant tests** focus on system-wide properties that must always hold true, not just the result of a single function.

> Example: *"The total ETH in the Handler + WETH contract must always equal the initial ETH supply."*

---

### 2. Open vs Constrained Invariants
âœ… **Open Invariants**: Allow the fuzzer to call any function with random inputs, simulating chaos.  
âœ… **Constrained Invariants**: Structure the fuzzer by bounding inputs and scenarios for more realistic behaviors.

---

### 3. Bounded vs Unbounded Invariants
âœ… **Bounded Invariants**: Use `bound()` to restrict fuzz inputs (e.g., deposits must not exceed balance).  
âœ… **Unbounded Invariants**: Full randomization, higher exploration but with lots of noise (reverts).

---

### 4. Handler Contracts
âœ… **Handlers** act as middlemen contracts that:
- Wrap the functions of the original contract under test.
- Allow cheatcodes like `vm.prank`, `deal`, etc.
- Simulate realistic environment setups.
- Introduce controlled randomness for testing.

---

### 5. Selectors
âœ… **Selectors** allow you to choose specific contract functions for fuzzing instead of exposing the entire contract surface.

> Use `targetSelector` with precise function selectors to improve fuzz test focus and efficiency.

---

### 6. Actors
âœ… **Actors** simulate different users interacting with the system (multi-address fuzzing):
- Tracked via a custom `AddressSet`.
- Functions like deposit, withdraw, transfer are fuzzed across many users.
- Introduces realism compared to all calls coming from just the Handler address.

## ðŸ“œ Summary of Testing Techniques

| Concept              | Purpose                                                         |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invariant properties | Ensure critical system properties always hold.                  |
| Handlers             | Control interactions and environment for realistic fuzzing.     |
| Selectors            | Limit fuzzing to critical contract methods.                     |
| Actors               | Simulate a true multi-user environment.                         |
| Ghost Variables      | Track off-chain events like total deposits, withdrawals, etc.    |
| ForcePush            | Simulate `selfdestruct` scenarios that forcibly push ETH to contracts.|

> **Tip:**  
> Consider adding a `/test/handlers/` folder for handlers, using structured test file naming like `ContractName.invariants.t.sol` and applying `targetSelector` cleanly in `setUp()`.
